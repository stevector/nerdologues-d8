# Nerdologues - Drupal 8 site

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/stevector/nerdologues-d8.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/stevector/nerdologues-d8)

A Composer-based repo for the Drupal 8 code behind [nerdologues.com](https://nerdologues.com). The work being done here is covered in blog posts on [stevector.com](http://stevector.com/2016/06/drupal-7-to-drupal-8-migration-diary-part-1-what-have-i-gotten-myself-into/).

This project was also used as the basis of [a presentation at DrupalCon Seattle 2019 about Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/1001-ci-builds-story-drupal-7-8-migration). If you're interested in seeing the migration code you can see it in [this pull request where it was removed](https://github.com/stevector/nerdologues-d8/pull/303). The migration code was not needed anymore after the site was live in Drupal 8.
